# Pretty

Simple pretty printers in Swift, based on [Wadler's pretty printers](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/prettier/prettier.pdf). If you need something more tested, use [DoctorPretty](https://github.com/bkase/DoctorPretty)

The key idea in these pretty printers is to build a datatype that supports *choice*: a document can render either one way or another. 

## Examples

```swift
```
